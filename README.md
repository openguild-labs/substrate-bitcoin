# Substrate Bitcoin-like Blockchain with UTXO account model

## Academy-PoW

This repository is generated from [Academy-PoW](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/Academy-PoW) repository. 


However, during implement Bitcoin-like blockchain, I've to update and fix a lot to make sure to code run smoothly.


Significantly, I've bumped Polkadot-SDK to stable-2407. That's quite complected but I've made it thanks to comprehensive document of OpenGuild's Polkadot SDK course.

## Substrate UTXO Workshop

This version builds upon the work of giants from [Building a UTXO Chain from Scratch | Substrate Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuJmxMMHvDw), with even more inspiration (I believe! ðŸ˜ƒ).

## Proof of Work

- Discover [Proof-of-Work (PoW)](docs/pow/pow.md)
- Understanding overview of PoW in Substrate by reading [code breakdown](docs/pow/code-breakdown.md).


## UTXO

- Discover [What is UTXO account model?](docs/utxo/utxo.md)
- Understanding overview of UTXO in Substrate by reading [code breakdown](docs/utxo/code-breakdown.md).


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this interactive tutorial, make sure you complete the initial tutorials on Substrate development from the official documentation. If you haven't gone through them yet, please review them first to build a solid foundation.

- [Substrate develop environment: Select your environment and complete `Install required packages and Rust`)](https://docs.substrate.io/install/)
- [Substrate Tutorial](https://polkadot.study/tutorials/interactive-substrate-tutorials-rusty-crewmates/)
- [Polkadot SDK doc](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html)
- [Substrate simulate a network](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-a-blockchain/simulate-network/)
